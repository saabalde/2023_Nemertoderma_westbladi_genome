## Decontamination
Unlike any of the other xenacoelomorph genomes, this genome was not sequenced from a cultured specimen. This means it is likely many contaminants were sequenced alongside _N. westbladi_, such as epidermic symbionts, the microbiome, or DNA suspended in the seawater. To filter out these contigs, we have used [BlobTools2](https://blobtoolkit.genomehubs.org/blobtools2/), which uses BLAST searches, coverage information, and the results from BUSCO to produce several metrics.

Herein I will assume all the relevant files are in the working directory:

### 1. Download the taxonomic information from the NCBI

### 2. Download and format the Uniprot database

### 3. Assign a taxonomic category to each of the contigs

### 4. Calculate the coverage

### 5. Assess the genome completeness

### 6. Put everything together

### How clean is the genome?
